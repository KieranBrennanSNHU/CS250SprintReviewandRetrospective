# CS250SprintReviewandRetrospective

Interpretting user needs and implementing them into the program is primarily done by the product owner and scrum master. The user "needs" are attributes of the product they would like and are turned into stories. These stories are worked on by the developers, so there is some interpetation there as well, but the product owner should get enough information to make the stories as clear as possible. I approach developing programs wih a flexible mindset. I understand that as I develop programs the processes I use might change as I find better ways to solve the problem and I have to be willing to chnage with it. I hope to incorporate the sprint review into my process because I think it is an important way to learn and commit programming to memory. I think being a good team member in in software development means that you are able to hold up your end, even if that means you do not know as much as other developers. You also need to be felxible and willing to learn new ways of programming to fit other roles.
